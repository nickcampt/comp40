1. Not a lot of external help.

2. What has been implemented:
A:  Two-Dimensional, Polymorphic, Unboxed Arrays
        Everything is implemented correctly according to the spec.
        We created a 2D representation using a single UArray_T.
        All memory is freed.
B: Two-Dimensional Arrays of Bits
        Everything in implemented correctly according to the spec.
        We created a 2D representation using a single Hanson Bit Vector.
        All memory is freed.
C: Using the UArray2 Abstraction to identify Sudoku Solutions
        Everything is implemented correctly.
        We have 3 check functions to make sure the sudoku board is valid.
        All memory is freed.
D: Using Bit2 Abstraction to Remove Black Edges
        Everything is implemented correctly.
        We have a semi-recursive function to convert all black-edge pixels.
        All memory is freed.
E: Programming Technique
        Our technique is about keeping track of memory allocation and freeing
        memory right as we allocate and checking valgrind often.

3. Approximate Time Spent: 17 hours
