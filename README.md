# comp40

This is the work from Tufts' core programming corse "Machine Structure and Assembly-Language Programming"

Students are taught C, Some Assembly-Style Languages, and learn machine architectures. 

Students also are given intense coding assignments to hone their programming skills. 

The joke is 40 hours a week on comp40 !
